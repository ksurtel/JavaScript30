    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array

    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[3] = 'Mux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice(); // returns the original array
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players); // this one works as well

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players]; // the snazziest way

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
      name: 'Kamil surtel',
      age: 105,
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // const capt = person;
    // capt.number = 42; // makes a reference istead, updates the original object

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 31});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // capt3 = {...person} // doesn't work yet, see above

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
